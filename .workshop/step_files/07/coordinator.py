"""TravelBuddy multi-agent Coordinator — build the handoff graph.

Fill in the TODOs below by reading the delivered slices, following
docs/steps/07-multi-agent.md.

The per-specialist ``agents/<name>/agent.yaml`` + ``agent.manifest.yaml`` slices
are already written for you and *describe* each specialist's role and capability
boundary, but nothing loads them at runtime. **This file is the executable
source of truth** — you translate each slice into code here:

- ``agents/<name>/agent.yaml`` -> the ``*_INSTRUCTIONS`` constant below
  (its ``instructions:`` block).
- ``agents/<name>/agent.manifest.yaml`` -> that specialist's ``tools=[...]`` and
  ``context_providers=[...]`` arguments (its ``tools`` / ``rag`` / ``skills``).

Keep the two in sync: the slice is the reviewable contract, this file is what runs.

Stuck? The complete, runnable version lives at
.workshop/solutions/07-multi-agent/travel_assistant/coordinator.py — including
the full skills provider that also downloads the Foundry response-guardrails
skill from the project at startup.

# TODO: carry run_local_skill_script over from your Step 6 main.py so the
# Activities specialist can run the local travel-guide skill (it renders the final
# PDF trip guide), and build the SkillsProvider that serves it. If you built the
# Foundry response-guardrails skill in Step 6, serve it here too so Activities can
# guardrail its answer; if you skipped it (no public-network Foundry project), serve
# only the local skill and drop the response-guardrails line from ACTIVITIES_INSTRUCTIONS.
# Why Activities and not the Coordinator? In a runtime handoff the Coordinator issues
# the handoff tool calls and is re-invoked after each hand-back, so it can't also
# carry a context provider — the extra tool stream breaks the store=False history
# replay. The skills therefore ride on a leaf specialist. Step 8's workflow adds a
# dedicated finalize node that CAN own the deliverable.

#   - Role: understand the request, route to the right specialist, synthesize one answer.
#   - Routing rules (one line each, matching each slice's `description`):
#       Flights -> timing, airports, routes, layovers, weather risk, fares
#       Hotels  -> lodging areas, budgets, amenities, neighbourhood trade-offs
#       Activities -> experiences, day trips, destination guidance, itineraries
#   - Full trip: hand off to each relevant specialist, then reconcile into one plan.
#   - You are the only agent who talks to the traveler: when a specialist hands
#     back because a detail is missing, ask the traveler yourself rather than
#     routing straight back to that specialist (which can loop).
#   - Ask a clarifying question only when a missing detail blocks the next step;
#     keep the traveler informed when routing.
#   (The Coordinator is a pure router — the travel-guide PDF and response-guardrails
#    ride on the Activities specialist, not here; see the skills TODO above.)
